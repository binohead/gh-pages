I don't know).<br><br>But mainly, I posted it because I've always wondered about its milky sap. I see from the trusted internet that its milkiness is why the plant was fed to lactating sows, and thus the name. But I wasn't satisfied with that answer (being a seeker of the Truth and all).<br><br>I still don't have an answer, perhaps because I have the wrong question: why do sow thistles, milkweed, dandelions, etc etc all have milky sap?  Perhaps there's no answer, because they're each there for a different reason.<br><br>But they have at least some aspects in common, besides that they're white. For instance, I read that sow thistle latex was used as chewing gum, like milkweed was. Then again, I also read that it's used to cure warts, which is a new one on me.<br><br>So maybe it's a question for you readers out there. Why do all those plants have a milky sap? Oh yeah, you can't answer because I didn't code comments into this. And I haven't made this blog public anyway.<br><br>Oh well, I'll just have to keep Seeking.</p>",

But what really got my attention was that it wasn't just crows, but robins, grackles, and others, too.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"19:1-19:366\">While my companions looked at the flowers (the garden has an astounding array of heritage roses, cultivars of heather, others - anyway, just plants), I hunted down what the fuss was about. I came up empty, and was about to give up, when I thought I might have seen the tell-tale tiger pattern that could be a Great-horned Owl's underside, or could be just tree bark.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"21:1-21:490\">I was glad I persisted in finding the right place to view the tree from. It was surprisingly far from the tree (had to take out a few heirloom roses along the way, but it was worth it). And, also surprising, the crows had given up by then, by which point I used to give up searching, thinking that if an owl was there, they'd persist. But I've recently found that rule doesn't hold at all; crows really are smart enough to back off if the owl hasn't moved and there's a creepy human around.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"23:1-23:405\">I run into Barred Owls a long, but it had been a long time since I'd seen a great-horned. What is it with owls? No matter how often you run into them, they deliver that reliable buzz of mingled excitement and awe. Perhaps it's a chemical release from a brain centre we inherited from our tree shrew ancestors: despite ourselves, they scare the shit out of us, and we'd like to know exactly where they are.</p>",

I suspect their numbers here were unprecedented.  I tweeted about this last year.

This species was one of the specimens he sent back from Greenland, and a professor named it after him. Holboell named species; Hornemann's Redpoll is a botanist he knew.</p>\n<p>Alas, Hoelboell's bird (like Hornemann's) was deemed, years later, to be a mere subspecies of Red-necked Grebe. And so the young kids don't even know Holboell's name any more. Then again, its genus is still <em>Podiceps</em>, which means \"anus foot\", because grebes' feet are so close to their butts. So not all is lost.</p>",
