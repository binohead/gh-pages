                <p>A random weed, growing from crevices on the Tower Road bridge across the railroad tracks, but then it's everywhere. Why would I feature it? Partly because I keep mixing up all the plants that look like that, for instance hawkweed ...</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://binohead.github.io/media/posts/11/hawkweed.jpg" alt="" width="333" height="592" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw" srcset="https://binohead.github.io/media/posts/11/responsive/hawkweed-xs.jpg 384w ,https://binohead.github.io/media/posts/11/responsive/hawkweed-sm.jpg 600w ,https://binohead.github.io/media/posts/11/responsive/hawkweed-md.jpg 768w ,https://binohead.github.io/media/posts/11/responsive/hawkweed-lg.jpg 1200w ,https://binohead.github.io/media/posts/11/responsive/hawkweed-xl.jpg 1600w"></figure>
<p>... many of which are edible, more (wild lettuce) or less (hawkweed?? I don't know).<br><br>But mainly, I posted it because I've always wondered about its milky sap. I see from the trusted internet that its milkiness is why the plant was fed to lactating sows, and thus the name. But I wasn't satisfied with that answer (being a seeker of the Truth and all).<br><br>I still don't have an answer, perhaps because I have the wrong question: why do sow thistles, milkweed, dandelions, etc etc all have milky sap?  Perhaps there's no answer, because they're each there for a different reason.<br><br>But they have at least some aspects in common, besides that they're white. For instance, I read that sow thistle latex was used as chewing gum, like milkweed was. Then again, I also read that it's used to cure warts, which is a new one on me.<br><br>So maybe it's a question for you readers out there. Why do all those plants have a milky sap? Oh yeah, you can't answer because I didn't code comments into this. And I haven't made this blog public anyway.<br><br>Oh well, I'll just have to keep Seeking.</p>

                <p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:207">Crows were making a racket in a corner of the Royal Annapolis Royal Gardens (did I get the name right?). But what really got my attention was that it wasn't just crows, but robins, grackles, and others, too.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:366">While my companions looked at the flowers (the garden has an astounding array of heritage roses, cultivars of heather, others - anyway, just plants), I hunted down what the fuss was about. I came up empty, and was about to give up, when I thought I might have seen the tell-tale tiger pattern that could be a Great-horned Owl's underside, or could be just tree bark.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:490">I was glad I persisted in finding the right place to view the tree from. It was surprisingly far from the tree (had to take out a few heirloom roses along the way, but it was worth it). And, also surprising, the crows had given up by then, by which point I used to give up searching, thinking that if an owl was there, they'd persist. But I've recently found that rule doesn't hold at all; crows really are smart enough to back off if the owl hasn't moved and there's a creepy human around.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:405">I run into Barred Owls a long, but it had been a long time since I'd seen a great-horned. What is it with owls? No matter how often you run into them, they deliver that reliable buzz of mingled excitement and awe. Perhaps it's a chemical release from a brain centre we inherited from our tree shrew ancestors: despite ourselves, they scare the shit out of us, and we'd like to know exactly where they are.</p>

                <p>There's a Gray Catbird in my local patch this winter that everybody sees except me. It's driving me nuts.</p>
<p>But that's what catbirds do. The skulk. They lurk. Now you see them, now you don't. They live up to their name, <em>Dumetella </em>(little one of the thorny bushes).</p>
<p>Thus they've appeared throughout the winter now and then, here and there, where they were first spotted in the fall (local readers: these include Point Pleasant Park, Conrose Park, Atlantic Theological Seminary, and lots of rose bushes in Dartmouth).</p>
<p> This winter's unusual that way because they were everywhere this past falI. I suspect their numbers here were unprecedented.  I tweeted about this last year. Surely you saw the tweet.  It had one of my first gifs, and was vivid and skillfull:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"> </p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/binohead/status/941326567556476933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></a>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
 </blockquote>
<p>Why'd that happen? It was a crazy fall for other birds, too, from killdeers to tanagers. Perhaps a topic for another post.</p>

                <p>The Red-necked Grebe in the photo was unusually close to shore in the harbour. Five off my patch this afternoon reminded me: my first field guides called them Holboell's Grebes.</p>
<p>That's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Peter_Holb%C3%B8ll" title="Carl Peter Holbøll">Carl Peter Holbøl</a>, who was Denmark's Royal Inspector of Colonies and Whaling back in the day (1820s). This species was one of the specimens he sent back from Greenland, and a professor named it after him. Holboell named species; Hornemann's Redpoll is a botanist he knew.</p>
<p>Alas, Hoelboell's bird (like Hornemann's) was deemed, years later, to be a mere subspecies of Red-necked Grebe. And so the young kids don't even know Holboell's name any more. Then again, its genus is still <em>Podiceps</em>, which means "anus foot", because grebes' feet are so close to their butts. So not all is lost.</p>
